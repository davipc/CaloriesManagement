- REST: 
	- change integration tests to use DB Unit (enable rollback after each test)
	- block changing of user roles by DEFAULT users
- Front:
	- Form validation: change to Angular's
	- user adm page (admin view) - roles loading incompletely on the first load (example: user dcavalca) - CAUSE: ADMIN USER CHANGED HIS ROLES LIST, AND ROLES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY UPDATED IN SESSION ON USER CHANGE - KEEP THIS WAY
